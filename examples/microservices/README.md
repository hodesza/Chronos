## Microservices Architecture
Microservices architecture for testing [Chronos](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Chronos), a microservice communication and health visualizer.

## Purpose and Design
This sample microservices architecture allows developers to explore the functionality of Chronos. It consists of four microservices, which are contained within the directories:
- Reverse Proxy
- Books
- Customers
- Orders

Each microservice has its own server, which receives requests from both the client and from other microservices. Books, Customers, and Orders also have their own databases, which they can query to respond to those requests.

## Getting Started w/ gRPC Example Microservices 

Follow **'main'** branch READ>ME steps: Pre-Installation, Install Dependencies before start. 

On each microservice in example/microserivces, perform the following steps
  - *Do this for microservices: books, orders, & reverse proxy
  - Install dotenv `npm install dotenv`
  - Create a .env file across each ,microservices and input your own Mongodb Atlast URI for both Microservice_URI and CHRONOS_URI
    - ** Reverse Proxy .env file will only require CHRONOS_URI

```
BOOK_URI = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.o2hx5.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

CHRONOS_URI = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.o2hx5.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
  - In each Microservice Mode.js file import and set the Microservice_URI

```
const myURI = process.env.BOOK_URI;

```

  - In each of the chronos-config.js files, import and set URI property in database to the Chronos_URI as shown

```
require('dotenv').config();
const chronos = require('chronos-tracker');

chronos.use({
  microservice: 'name of microservice e.g books or orders',
  interval: 2000,
  database: {
      type: 'MongoDB'
      URI: process.env.CHRONOS_URI
    },
  notifications: [],
})
```
  - **Note: The Initialize Chronos step is already taken care of for you. 
  - Run `npm run start` in each folder directory
    - To do so, within each microservice directory, install all dependencies using the `npm install`
  - Head over to localhost:3000 to view reverse proxy acting as the frontend of this microservice example
  - Start adding data!
  - Run `npm run both` to start Electron app
    - Add a new application in Chronos app dashboard.
    - The URI should be your CHRONOS_URI


**To test the functionality of Chronos using this sample microservices architecture, you must install the [Chronos node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chronos-microservice-debugger3) within each microservice. _It is not pre-installed._ Installation instructions for both the Chronos node module and the Chronos desktop visualizer are below:**

## Installation

Chronos consists of a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) and a lightweight [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) desktop application.

#### Node module

To install the [Chronos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chronos-microservice-debugger3) node module within each microservice, use the
[`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally)command:

```
npm install chronos-tracker
```

Once installed, write the following two lines at the top of each microservice's server file:
```javascript
const cmd = require('chronos-tracker');
cmd.propagate();
```

Then add a route handler for all incoming requests:
```js
app.use('/', cmd.microCom('microserviceName', 'databaseType', 'databaseURL', 'wantMicroHealth', 'queryFrequency'))
```

The cmd.microCom handler function logs communication and health data to a user-provided database. This is to ensure that your private data stays private. We currently support MongoDB and SQL/PostgreSQL databases.

cmd.microCom takes four parameters and an optional fifth parameter. You can enter the arguments as individual strings or as an array.

The parameters are:
1. microserviceName: To identify the microservice (i.e. "payments")
2. databaseType: Enter either "mongo" or "sql"
3. databaseURL: Enter the URL of your database
4. wantMicroHealth: Do you want to monitor the health of this microservice? Enter "yes" or "no"
5. queryFrequency (optional): How frequently do you want to log the health of this microservice? It defaults to every minute, but you can choose:
  * "s" : every second
  * "m" : every minute (default)
  * "h" : every hour
  * "d" : once per day
  * "w" : once per week

String parameter example:
```javascript
app.use('/', cmd.microCom('payments', 'mongo', 'mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0-abc.mongodb.net/','yes','h'))
```

Array parameter example:
```javascript
let values = [
  'payments',
  'mongo',
  'mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0-abc.mongodb.net/',
  'yes',
  'h'
]

app.use('/', cmd.microCom(values)
```

#### Electron desktop application

After installing the node module in each microservice, download the Electron desktop application from the public [Chronos](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Chronos) repo.

Inside the downloaded directory, install all dependencies using the `npm install` command followed by the `npm run both` command to start the Electron desktop application.
